Thermal and Beanies started of well in 2023 and plunged in 2024 and tried to make recoveries i the winter of 2025. \n\n **Materials:** Much as cotton is trending highly, its numbers were took a dive from 2024 - 2025 winters; Wool, Polyester, Down, Cashmere and leather ended better than they started in 2023. Like cotton, fleece also plunged in 2025 as compare to 2024 but still performed better than 2023.\n\n**Color:** Beige and black have had a consistent ride in numbers unlike other colors of garmets than have either had a rise and drop (Green, cream, red,gray) or dropped and rose(Brown,white, blue).\n\n**Styles:** While the rest of the style started at the bottom and by 2025 were doing better, Sporty and casual garmets dropped in number by 2025. However, the drop in sporty garmets was significantly large from 2023 to 2024 and though it reecovered, did not come close to the where it stated.\n\n**Gender:** Unisex winter garmets have always had high numbers than both male and female, and continue to rise; Male and female winter garmets have also increased in number in the last two years.\n\n***Conclusion:*** Winter of 2024 had alot of uncertainity which need to be investigated further.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***Numerical variables over time***","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()\nplt.figure(figsize=(14,4))\n#Price average by season\nplt.subplot(1,3,1)\nstyle_counts7 = df.groupby('Season')['Price(USD)'].mean()\nsns.lineplot(data=style_counts7)\nplt.title(\"Overall mean garmet price over time\")\n#Popularity Score by season\nplt.subplot(1,3,2)\nstyle_counts8 = df.groupby('Season')['Popularity_Score'].mean()\nsns.lineplot(data=style_counts8)\nplt.title(\"Overall mean Popularity Score over time\")\n#Customer rating\nplt.subplot(1,3,3)\nstyle_counts9 = df.groupby('Season')['Customer_Rating'].mean()\nsns.lineplot(data=style_counts9)\nplt.title(\"Overall mean customer rating over time\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-28T17:28:20.667144Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-28T17:28:20.667471Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-28T17:28:21.199894Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-12-28T17:28:20.667442Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-28T17:28:21.198731Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***Findings 9b: Overtime changes***\n\nAlthough not much insight can be taken from the popularity score and customer rating averages, the mean prices seems to show a significant increase in the prices of garmets in winter 2025 and a plunge that had taken place in 2024; perhaps this plunge would explain the drops and rises in several factors of the categorical variables in the same period such as increase in luxury garmets or cotton.\n\nCustormer rating followed the same pattern as price, hinting at a relationship that was earier unseen in the correlation matrix(needs more exploring).\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***Test hypotheses from component analysis.***\n\n**1.

Pearson correlation tests consistently produced p-values greater than 0.05, leading to the conclusion that no statistically significant linear relationships exist among these variables. This suggests that higher prices or popularity scores do not necessarily translate into better customer ratings, highlighting the complexity of consumer preferences in winter fashion.\n\nTrend status analysis revealed meaningful behavioral patterns. Trending garments are the most purchased on average, followed by emerging, classic, and outdated items. Interestingly, outdated garments recorded higher popularity scores, likely due to cumulative historical engagement, while customers rated trending garments the highest, indicating a stronger alignment between current trends and consumer satisfaction.\n\nBrand analysis showed that The North Face dominated purchases, followed by H&M, while Levi’s recorded the lowest purchase frequency. In terms of style, some categories experienced noticeable declines and partial recoveries over time, though they did not return to previous peaks. Unisex winter garments consistently maintained high demand, while women’s winter apparel showed growth over the past two years, reflecting shifting consumer preferences.\n\nOvertime analysis highlighted notable uncertainty during the winter of 2024, with fluctuations in price, popularity score, and customer ratings. While popularity score trends alone were not highly informative, changes in pricing and customer ratings suggested evolving market dynamics, such as increasing interest in luxury garments and specific materials like cotton. Customer ratings appeared to follow price trends, hinting at relationships not fully captured by simple correlation analysis and warranting deeper investigation.\n\nOverall, this EDA establishes a strong foundation for further analysis. Future work could explore non-linear relationships, time-series modeling, or segmentation approaches to better understand evolving fashion trends and consumer behavior in winter apparel.","metadata":{}}]}
